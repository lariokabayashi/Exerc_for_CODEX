# codex_exercises

* Clone the repository:\
user@host:~$ git clone https://github.com/larissacodex/codex_exercicios

* Run exerc x (x is the number of the exercise):\
user@host:~/diretorio$ python exerc_x_codex.py\
Only exerc 7 cannot be executable 

* I also documented the exercises in Google Colab so it gets easier to run the exercises, reminding that only exerc 1-3 can run in this plataform, because the others aren't so simple so they can run in it. In this case, run the exercise in the other way.\

* For exerc 7 it was created a table in Excel to organize the data: https://unicampbr-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/l247220_m_unicamp_br/EVtHxuJZRz9Ovx76UNQc1qkBnwUtdWjUrJS7Fg5IAOWrPA?e=k6fHAS \

* For exerc 8 I uploaded the images of the design of the app in the repository, the "app_first_page.png" is the "sign in" screen and the "app_second_page.png" is the screen for designing new electrical networks.
